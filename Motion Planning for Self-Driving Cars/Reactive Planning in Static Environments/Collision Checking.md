# Collision Checking

## Collision Checking Challenges

* Computationally intensive
* Requires perfect information to guarantee I safety
* Needs to be approximated, and must be robust to noise

## Swath Computation

* Area occupied by car along path generated by rotating the car's footprint by each $x, y,\theta$ along the path
* Swath along path is the union of each rotated and translated footprint
* Swath can then be checked for collisions

$$S=\cup_{p\in P}F\left(x\left(p\right),y\left(p\right),\theta\left(p\right) \right)$$

### Discretized Example

<img alt="Initial state" src="./Initial state.jpg" style="height:30vh;margin: 1em auto; display:block;"/>

* Initial state of the vehicle in the occupancy grid, with base link at the origin
* Will need to rotate and translate to get the new footprint at point $(1.0, 2.0, \frac{\pi}{2})$

1. First, rotate the footprint about the
origin by $\frac{\pi}{2}$
2. Next, translate each point by $(1.0, 2.0)$

* To compute the occupancy grid index for each point in the footprint, add half the width/height of the occupancy grid, and divide by the grid resolution $\delta$
* Swath is then the union of these indices

$$x_i=\frac{x(p)+\frac{X}{2}}{\delta}\\
y_i=\frac{y(p)+\frac{Y}{2}}{\delta}$$

$$S=S\cup\left(x_i,y_i\right)$$
